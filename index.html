<body>The first time I took the CPA exam, I scored a 26. Yes, my score was a failing score. It got the best of me on most days and I lived with that reality for the next 4 years; knowing that I had given up. But just temporarily. Because today, I am a licensed CPA in the state of Maryland. 
    
    So I made a website to share my exam story and to dive into what it's to prepare for the testing experience and how I got here. You may be a current candidate, a prospective accounting student, or someone like me who took the scenic route to get to CPAland. Whatever it is that brought you here, stick around. 

It might not be worth your while just yet but I do feel like I have a few good stories and there are probably others you could relate with.
